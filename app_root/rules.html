<h1>Basic Rules of Bocce</h1>

<p>The object of the game is to roll your bocce balls closer to the pallino (jack) ball than your opponent.
Bocce can be played on most surfaces (grass or sand) as long as they are fairly smooth and flat.
Court is 60 feet long by 12 feet wide; however, the court size can be accommodated to fit the playing
space available.</p>


<h2>Players:</h2>
<ul>
<li>One player per team = four balls per player</li>
<li>Two players per team = two balls per player</li>
<li>Four player per team = one ball per player</li>
</ul>

<h2>Playing Bocce:</h2>
<p>The game consists of several frames. A frame starts with tossing the pallino by a team toward the
opposite end of the playing court. The game (frame) is complete after the balls have been thrown
and points awarded. Balls are tossed or rolled underhand.
Whoever wins the coin toss will begin by tossing the pallino into the playing area. The pallino must
be thrown past the center line and not further than the four foot line. If the pallino lands out of the
designated area, the opposing team will throw the pallino into the playing area.</P>

<p>Once the pallino is in position, the first team throws their bocce ball. Taking alternate turns, each
team throws their balls toward the pallino to (A) get their ball closest to the pallino, (B) to move the
pallino closer to their ball, or (C) move the opponent’s ball. The winning team begins the next frame.</P>
<p>
Frames are played alternately from one end of the court to the other.
</P>

<h2>Scoring:</h2><p>
In each frame, only one team scores. One point is given for each bocce ball that is closer to the
pallino than the opposing team’s bocce balls. The pallino distance marker can be used to determine
which balls are closer.</p><p>
The game continues until 12 points have been scored or to pre-determined points set by the players
before the game starts.
Note: Safety should be observed when playing bocce. It is recommended that players stay outside
for the playing area when balls are being tossed.</P>
